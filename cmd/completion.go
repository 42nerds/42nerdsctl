Output shell completion code for bash. The shell code must be evaluated
to provide interactive completion of 42nerdsctl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from the
.bash_profile.

Examples:
	# Installing bash completion on macOS using homebrew
	## If running Bash 3.2 included with macOS
	brew install bash-completion
	## or, if running Bash 4.1+
	brew install bash-completion@2
	## If you've installed, you may need add the completion to your completion
directory
	42nerdsctl completion > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/42nerdsctl


	# Installing bash completion on Linux
	## Load the 42nerdsctl completion code for bash into the current shell
	source <(42nerdsctl completion bash)
`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		rootCmd.GenBashCompletion(os.Stdout)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(completionCmd)
}
